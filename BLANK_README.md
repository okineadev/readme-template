## About The Project

Here's a blank template to get started: To avoid retyping too much info. Do a search and replace with your text editor for the following: `github_username`, `repo_name`, `project_title`, `project_description`

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

* npm

  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```

3. Install NPM packages

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Enter your API in `config.js`

   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```

5. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project

   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```
